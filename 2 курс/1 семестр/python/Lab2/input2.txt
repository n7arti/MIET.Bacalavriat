A person can fall in love quickly. As British scientists confirm, it will take 8.2 seconds for a person to fall in love with someone. The scientists explain that
a look of 4 seconds is a right proof that a man is impressed and interested. But there is an interesting thing that this rule doesn’t work for women. This look means
nothing for them. They can look at a man even much longer without falling in love.

British scientists decided to study it and invite more than one hundred students for an experiment. Then they hid cameras to observe the movements of the students’ 
eyes. Then students were asked to complete a form.
